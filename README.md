# ConformationClustering
**Clustering conformational states of macromolecules in cryo-em.**

This project aims at developing an method for clustering macromolecules into different conformational states. Since the macromolecules can change their structures during the acquisition process of cryo-em and in some cases, it is not simple to know in priority the number of clusters. The method is based on the hierarchical Hungarian algorithm which does not need to specify the number of clusters.
